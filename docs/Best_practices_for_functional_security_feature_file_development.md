# Best practices for functional security feature file development

## Introduction
As software development continues to evolve, security has become a critical aspect of the development process. Incorporating security testing into the software development lifecycle is essential to identify and mitigate potential security threats early on. One effective approach for identifying and addressing security threats is STRIDE threat modeling, which provides a structured framework for analyzing the security of a software system.

STRIDE is an acronym that stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. These categories encompass a wide range of security threats, including impersonation attacks, data tampering, repudiation attacks, data leaks, service disruptions, and privilege escalation, among others. By using STRIDE as a framework, teams can systematically identify potential threats and take appropriate measures to address them.

Gherkin, a popular language for writing behavior-driven development (BDD) scenarios, provides a powerful way to create security tests using Scenario Outlines. Scenario Outlines allow testers to generate multiple test scenarios from a single outline, making them ideal for security testing, where a wide range of scenarios and edge cases need to be considered.

In this best practices document, we will explore how to generate STRIDE-based Scenario Outlines in Gherkin to create effective security tests. We will provide guidelines on how to structure Scenario Outlines, use examples to cover different scenarios and edge cases, and incorporate STRIDE threat categories into the examples. We will also highlight best practices for writing meaningful input data and fostering collaboration between security experts, developers, and testers.

By following these best practices, you can leverage the power of Gherkin Scenario Outlines and the STRIDE threat modeling approach to create robust and effective security tests, leading to more secure software systems. Let's dive in and learn how to generate STRIDE-based Scenario Outlines in Gherkin!

## What is STRIDE Threat Modeling?

STRIDE is an acronym that stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. Each category represents a different type of security threat that can be addressed through specific application development requirements.

### Spoofing

Spoofing refers to the act of impersonating a legitimate user or system entity in order to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate spoofing threats, the following application development requirements can be considered:

- Implement strong authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users and systems.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security.
- Employ secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS, to prevent eavesdropping and tampering of data during transmission.
- Regularly monitor and log access attempts to detect potential spoofing attacks.

### Tampering

Tampering involves unauthorized modification or alteration of data or system components. To address tampering threats, the following application development requirements can be considered:

- Use cryptographic mechanisms, such as digital signatures or message integrity checks, to ensure the integrity of data and prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Implement strict access controls and permissions to limit the ability to modify critical data or system components.
- Regularly validate and sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or command injection.
- Implement audit trails and logs to detect and trace unauthorized tampering attempts.

### Repudiation

Repudiation refers to the ability of a user to deny their actions or transactions. To mitigate repudiation threats, the following application development requirements can be considered:

- Implement robust logging mechanisms to capture user actions, transactions, and system events.
- Use digital signatures or other cryptographic mechanisms to provide non-repudiation of user actions or transactions.
- Implement strict access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modification of logs or audit trails.
- Regularly review and analyze logs to detect and investigate potential repudiation attempts.

### Information Disclosure

Information Disclosure involves the unauthorized exposure or leakage of sensitive information. To address information disclosure threats, the following application development requirements can be considered:

- Implement encryption mechanisms, such as data-at-rest encryption or data-in-transit encryption, to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or exposure.
- Follow the principle of least privilege to restrict access to sensitive information based on user roles and permissions.
- Use secure coding practices to prevent information leakage through error messages, logs, or other application output.
- Regularly scan and test for vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS), that can lead to information disclosure.

### Denial of Service

Denial of Service (DoS) involves disrupting or impairing the availability or functionality of a system or service. To mitigate DoS threats, the following application development requirements can be considered:

- Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive requests or resource consumption.
- Use load balancing or failover mechanisms to distribute traffic and prevent single points of failure.
- Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) or firewalls to detect and block DoS attacks.
- Regularly monitor and analyze system performance and resource utilization to detect and mitigate potential DoS attacks.

### Elevation of Privilege

Elevation of Privilege involves gaining unauthorized access to higher levels of privilege or permissions. To address elevation of privilege threats, the following application development requirements can be considered:

- Implement the principle of least privilege to restrict user permissions based on their roles or privileges.
- Use strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to privileged accounts or functions.
- Regularly review and update user permissions to prevent unnecessary elevation of privilege.
- Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and alert on potential elevation of
